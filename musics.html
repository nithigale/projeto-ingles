        Yeah, I know sometimes <br>
        Things may not always make sense to you right now <br>
        But, hey, what daddy always tell you? <br>
        Straighten up, little soldier <br>
        Stiffen up that upper lip <br>
        What you cryin' about? <br>
        You got me <br>

        Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad <br>
        Well, I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had <br>
        I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh <br>
        I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry <br>
        'Cause you're scared, I ain't there <br>
        Daddy's with you in your prayers <br>
        No more cryin', wipe them tears <br>
        Daddy's here, no more nightmares <br>
        We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it <br>
        Lainie, uncle's crazy, ain't he? <br>
        Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it <br> 
        We're all we got in this world <br>
        When it spins, when it swirls <br>
        When it whirls, when it twirls <br>
        Two little beautiful girls <br>
        Lookin' puzzled, in a daze <br>
        I know it's confusin' you <br>
        Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news <br>
        I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems <br>
        The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me <br>
        All the things growin' up his as daddy that he had to see <br>
        Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did <br> 
        We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me <br>
        But things have gotten so bad between us <br>
        I don't see us ever bein' together ever again <br> 
        Like we used to be when we was teenagers <br>
        But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason <br>
        I guess it was never meant to be <br>
        But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is <br>
        But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep <br>
        Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream <br>

        Now hush, little baby, don't you cry <br>
        Everything's gonna be alright <br>
        Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya <br>
        Daddy's here to hold ya through the night <br>
        I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why <br>
        We feel how we feel inside <br>
        It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby <br>
        But I promise mama's gon' be alright <br>

        It's funny <br>
        I remember back one year, when daddy had no money <br>
        Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up <br>
        And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me <br>
        'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em <br>
        I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying <br>
        'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see, daddy had a job <br>
        But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom <br>
        And at the time, every house that we lived in <br>
        Either kept gettin' broke into and robbed or shot up on the block <br>
        And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar <br>
        Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college <br>
        Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it <br>
        And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart <br>
        And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart <br>
        Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back <br>
        On the Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom         apartment <br>
        And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara <br>
        And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre <br>
        And flew you and momma out to see me <br>
        But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me <br>
        Then you started seein' daddy on the TV and momma didn't like it <br>
        And you and Lainie were too young to understand it <br>
        Papa was a rolling stone, momma developed a habit <br>
        And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it <br>
        I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand <br>
        'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud <br>
        Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin' <br>
        Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out <br>
        To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now <br>
        Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here <br>
        Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here <br>
        I like the sound of that, yeah <br>
        It's got a ring to it, don't it? <br>
        Shh, mama's only gone for the moment <br>

        Now hush, little baby, don't you cry <br>
        Everything's gonna be alright <br>
        Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya <br>
        Daddy's here to hold ya through the night <br>
        I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why <br>
        We feel how we feel inside <br>
        It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby <br>
        But I promise mama's gon' be alright <br>

        And if you ask me to <br>
        Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird <br>
        I'ma give you the world <br>
        I'ma buy a diamond ring for you <br>
        I'ma sing for you <br>
        I'll do anything for you to see you smile <br>
        And if that mocking bird don't sing and that ring don't shine <br>
        I'ma break that birdie's neck <br>
        I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya <br>
        And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad (haha) <br>
